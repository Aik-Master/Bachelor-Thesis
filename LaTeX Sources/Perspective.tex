\noindent Tha analysis has shown that modern standards more focus the quality of sourcecode and less the performance. A view into the list of the features probably released with the C++17 standard shows that this trend will continue. Many design patterns more show a tendency of improvement with the new standards. I think spending time in implementing more established design pattern with modern C++ facilities is the right way to be prepared for the futures requirements on software development.
